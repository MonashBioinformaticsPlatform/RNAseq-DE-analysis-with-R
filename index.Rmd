The Monash Bioinformatics Platform wants to help make introductory bioinformatics approaches part of the research landscape in Biomedicine. To do this, a foundation level of expertise amongst as many researchers as possible is an important step forward.

This lesson focuses on enabling researchers to be able to analyse RNASeq (next-gen sequencing) data with R.

#### Prerequisites {.callout}

An understanding of the concepts of files and directories (including working
directory) is required.

Though not required, we often use RStudio when teaching this lesson.

A basic knowledge of the R language.
