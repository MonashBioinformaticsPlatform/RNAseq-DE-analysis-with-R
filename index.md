title: RNAseq Using R
---
The Monash Bioinformatics Platform want to help make introductory bioinformatic approaches part of the research landscape in Biomedicine. To do this, a foundation level of expertise amongst as many researchers as possible is an important step forward.

This lesson focuses on enabling researchers to be able to analyse RNASeq (next-gen sequencing) data.

> ## Prerequisites {.prereq}
>
> An understanding of the concepts of files and directories (including working
>directory) is required.
>
> Though not required, we often use RStudio when teaching this lesson.
